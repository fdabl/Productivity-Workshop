# How to stop being busy and become productive

This workshop has been presented twice at the 31st EFPSA Congress in Qakh, Azerbaijan.

> With the introduction of the World Wide Web, potential distractions have risen to unseen levels; they dominate our daily lives. Do you check Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, or Email on a constant basis? Do you have an embarrassing relationship with your alarm clock’s snooze button? Do you pass of social invites, telling other people that you are too busy? Do you, after years of studying, sometimes peek at your CV and feel like you haven’t accomplished what you had hoped for? As a generation, we have lost the ability to focus sharply on the task at hand; instead, we work on a multitude of things simultaneously, lamenting that we do not achieve the things we seek to achieve. Using personal examples, we share useful tips, tricks, and tools for you to stay on top of your day and move quickly from task to task, accomplishing the things that matter. We provide a three stage actionable program for you to work through in order to stop being busy and start being productive. Being productive is not merely about professional success; it includes physical fitness, social and family life; it entails growing as a person. On this note, we invite you to join our workshop and upgrade yourself!
